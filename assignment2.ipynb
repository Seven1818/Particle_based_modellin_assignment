    "- This Jupyter notebook with short and precise answers to the questions.  \n",

The use of [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor which work on Windows, Mac and Linux is also recommended. Some useful functions will also be provided in Python 3.x. Before you start, make sure that basic Python packages such as numpy, matplotlib, scipy and math are installed. Additionally, the plotly python package is also needed if you want to use the `view_trajectory` function."

    "## Coding tips\n",
    "### Guidelines\n",
    "Before you start the assignment, note that there are some relevant tips that will reduce the number of mistakes you make while coding. All the listed points went wrong by multiple students the last few years. Therefore keeping them in mind is relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Units, units, units.\n",
    "- Use clear names for your variables and functions. When specified, use the same function name as it makes evaluation easier.\n",
    "- Make sure to write clear comments.\n",
    "- See if python packages already provide the features you need. It's not neccesary to reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "- Only use LOCAL variables and avoid GLOBAL variables.\n",
    "- If you understand types, annotate your python functions. You will get warnings if your inputs are the wrong type or size, making it easier to find mistakes.\n",
    "- Use numpy as is when you can and avoid for or while loops which reduce your code speed significantly.\n",
    "- Investigate scaling of your code to make it faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not understand what the tip entails of why we advise it you can ask your search engine of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tackling performance issues\n",
    "The goal of the assignment is not to make the fastest code possible, otherwise we would have selected a different code language for the assignment. However, part 2 of this assignment will require you to model CH<sub>4</sub> more rigorously. If you code inefficiently, you will get problems here. From experience we know that students can get simulation times of 3 to 5 hours per state point, where solutions exist in python which give you a result within 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is smart to spend some time on optimizing your code. Investigating the optimization of your code in a jupyter notebook. For example, in the first assignment, you investigate the computational expense of computing the distance of every particle i to every particle j **WITHOUT** accounting for periodic boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process always has the same steps:\n",
    "1. Start with a super simple implementation for which you know you will get the right results.\n",
    "2. Think how you can vectorize your result. This means that you try to do the same operation on all parts of an array at once instead of performing calculations per element in the array.\n",
    "3. Think about what you really need to compute. Maybe you can leave out parts.\n",
    "4. Check if your optimized results match the simple approach.\n",
    "5. Test the speed of the function with the `%timeit` macro in jupyter. On a laptop only test your preformance with wall-power plugged in. On batteries laptops can make really unreliable power choices making comparisons not working well."
